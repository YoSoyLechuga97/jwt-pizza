# Incident: 2025-04-08 13-09-00

## Summary

```md
Between the hour of 17:30 to 18:00 UTC on April 8, ~12 users encountered a failure to order pizza. The event was triggered by a chaos monkey interrupting orders at 17:54:00. The chaos monkey contained the ability to block pizza-ordering logic.

A bug in this code caused all requests to the pizza factory to fail, returning a code 500. The event was detected by Grafana Logs. The team started working on the event by looking through the logs and dev tools. This Critical incident affected 100% of users.

No further impacts were raised in relation to this incident.

```

## Timeline

```md
All times are UTC.

- _17:54_ - First logged error report from franchise

- _18:10_ - Cole accesses Grafana to determine the error
- _18:20_ - Pizza Ordering determined to be the source of the error
- _18:30_ - Database confirmed to not be harmed
- _18:40_ - Cole tests ordering a pizza as a user, finds error http with devtools
- _18:50_ - First confirmed logs and metrics that pizza ordering is back up and running.
```

## Response

```md
After receiving a page at 18:04 UTC, Cole Strong came online at 18:10 UTC in JWT Pizza's Grafana Dashboard.

This engineer had admin access and was able to test and manipulate everything necessary to fix the issue. They first attempted to insure the database was clean before approaching the factory issue.
```

## Root cause

```md
A bug in the connection blocked factory requests to order pizza, a chaos monkey that left an http breadcrumb to hint where to go to end the block.
```

## Resolution

```md
Following the breadcrumb led us to the resolution of the chaos. As this was an intended attack there is little to do in regards to resolution other than improve the alert systems to be better equipped to trip if something like this were to occur. Improved alerts have been set for the following:

500 Status codes - decreased the rate per minute that they need to be logged in order to trip alert
0 Pizzas Ordered - default alert tripped if none ordered in the last hour.
```

## Prevention

```md
There are currently no other incidents that have been impacted in the same way.
```

## Action items

```md
1. View factory failure response body in logs
2. Go to http included in response body
3. Verify that pizza orders are back up and running.
```
